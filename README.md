## Instructions for completed projects

### Pixelator instructions:


The Pixelator_Folder contains two projects. 

Pixelator_Resizer is just to try and see the photo size on the canva if you want. 

Pixelator is the main program. 

Once you load the program in the web editor, you have to upload your image.

You can make it like in this video 
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&source_ve_path=Mjg2NjQsMTY0NTAz&feature=emb_share&v=rO6M5hj0V-o) (2:02 min).

After that you have to enter the name  of the image in the sketch.js file. The string is put in the '' of the imgString. 

For example if the image is called 'ExampleImage.jpg' it would look like this let imgString = 'ExampleImage.jpg'.

After that you can change the size of the canva. The width, the height and the resizer ( the resizer is being added to the width and height af the canvas).
You can also change the size of the pixels (bigger size => poorer quality; smaller size => better quality).

When you are ready with this steps you have to start the program from the play button on the top of the page. The image will be shown on the screen. After that you have to click once on the image (so the program can know you want to work with the image). 

After clicking on the image hold the left arrow for 1-2 sec. If nothing hapens press and hold for a bit more.  (If you press and hold for long enough you will see dots in every pixel).

***WARNING*** If notification like this is shown do not worry (it just will take more time to convert the image):

Then you can press the right arrow like the left arrow.

after the program is ready you should be hving the final result.

### Waveform visualizer instructions:

Once you load the program in the web editor, you have to upload your image.

You can make it like in this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&source_ve_path=Mjg2NjQsMTY0NTAz&feature=emb_share&v=rO6M5hj0V-o) (2:02 min).

After you are done with uploading your files to the program you have to change the 'songString' and the 'imageString'. You have to simply put the name of the song and image.

Then you can change the 'alphFade'. It will change the brightness of the canvas and the pulsing of the brightness from the music.

The next thing is the 'amplitude'. It will change the shaking of the image. Lower value equals more shaking.

The 'blurValue' is for the image. It blurs just the image.

The next two 'minWave' and 'maxWave' are for the minimum and maximum of the radius of the pulsing circle.

Last two things you can change are depending on your image. For best experience you can change the size of the canvas to be the same proportions as the size of the image.

Image of the result:  Enter Shikari - It Hurts

### Mandelbrot set instructions: 

You have to simply upload the file in your web editor.

After that you can change the values of the bounds. Higher value leads to higher quality (when zoomed in)

The next value is for the number of iterations that are made. Higher value leads to sharper result.

The scale is initial zoom level for the Mandelbrot set.

The last two parameters determine the position of the Mandelbrot set will be drawn on the canvas.

Once you are ready with the values you can start the program. 

You must have see this on your screen:
